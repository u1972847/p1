## Project analysis

### Final User


This project is made for users who are looking to hire on a specific IT field (SysAdmin/Software Developer). 
In my project they will find all the basic information needed to know if they are interested in contacting/hiring me.

<br />

### Information architecture

It's just a single-page project, so there's not much analysis to do.<br /><br />


### Visual design

- Color Palette:  
   - For the information on the left side I've used grey(#eae8e9) for the background, black for the text and blue for the titles(#5a86af). 
   - For the Right side I've just used black for the text and white for the background.
- Typography: 
  - I wanted to use 'Avenir' but a lot of browsers wouldn't have it installed so I opted to use 'Century' which every browser has and I personally think it's professional enough.
- Page layout: 
  - To get inspired I decided to look at a lot of people's CV. After some time I chose to do a simple Left and Right Layout, I think it's the best way possible to give the information to the reader, it goes straight to the point and there aren't many things to get distracted.
